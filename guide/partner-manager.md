# Partner Manager Guide {#pm-guide}

## How do I know if someone meet the *partnership requirements*? {#requirements}
### Paid Partnership
- Must follow Discord [TOS](https://discord.com/terms) & No NSFW.
- Open a `#ticket` for more information.

### Partnership
- If you do not have **at-least 5,000 members** we will not partner.
- Must follow Discord [TOS](https://discord.com/terms) & No NSFW.
- Editing Server (optional)
- Have a good moderation/similar rules.
- Please submit a permanent invite while asking to partner. If the invite is found invalid later on, your ad will be deleted.


::: warning
We do not accept partnerships with other leaking servers unless approved by Ledd.

## What should I do if someone applies but **doesn’t meet** the *requirements*? {#requirements-2}

Politely let them know they don’t qualify and encourage them to reapply once they meet the criteria.

## Can I **accept** or **reject** partnerships on my own? {#acceptance}

Yes, you can, as long as the server meets our partnership requirements and is safe (no TOS violations, NSFW, or shady activity). We don’t restrict you from partnering elsewhere.

## Where do I respond to partnership requests? {#requests}

Use the designated ticket channel for partnerships.

## What if someone **keeps asking** for partnership even after being denied? {#denied}

Let a Moderator know. You’re not expected to handle persistent or pushy users alone.

## Can I **suggest** potential partners to the team? {#suggestions}

Yes! If you see a server or group that looks like a great fit, bring it up to Ledd or the team.

## What’s the difference between a **normal partner** and a **paid partner**? {#difference}

Normal partners must meet all the partnership requirements listed here: [**#requirements**](#requirements)
 
Paid partners don’t need to meet those requirements but must still follow our rules — especially no NSFW and must comply with Discord TOS. 
 
::: warning
All paid partnership requests must be forwarded to Ledd. Partner Managers are not allowed to process or approve them — only Ledd handles anything involving payments.
