# Frequently Asked Questions {#faq}

## What should I do if a member breaks the rules?

Always start with a warning unless the behavior is extreme (e.g., hate speech, threats, raids). Use common sense, stay calm, and log your action in the appropriate staff channel. If unsure, ask a higher-up before taking action.

## Where do I report incidents or escalate issues?

All staff actions (warns, mutes, bans, etc.) should be logged in the `#staff-cmd` channel. If a situation seems too complicated or serious, ping an admin or owner for assistant.

## What are the expectations for my role?

Each role (Moderator, Support, Partner Manager, Admin) has its own focus. This [guide](/) will walk you through what you're expected to handle, how to stay within your role, and when to pass something off to another team.

## Do I need to be active all the time?

Nope! But some consistency is expected. Just check in regularly, respond to pings, and communicate if you're going inactive for a while. Weâ€™d rather you say something than disappear without notice.

## Do I need to claim a ticket?

Yes, if you're handling a ticket, you must claim it. If you're unable to continue assisting, you can transfer it to another staff member using the `/transfer` command.
