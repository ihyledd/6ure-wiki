## Server Related {#server-related}

### Ticket 

If you claimed a ticket, please warn the member and close the ticket if no response are given for over 12 hours. This would help the server be less clogged.

### Booster Role

When a user opens a ticket to claim their custom role, please do the following:
1. **Verify Booster Status**: First, confirm that the member has boosted the server at least **twice** (`2x`). This is a strict requirement.
2. **Whitelist the Member**: Use the new command to grant them access to the role creation panel. (`/boosterrole whitelist`)

**Command:**
Using this command on a valid 2x booster will allow them to use `/boosterrole manage`. Please familiarize yourselves with this new procedure.

### Duplicate requests

Request duplicates can be monitored through: [#・request-log](https://discord.com/channels/1118862694980788276/1395469507014951063). You can simply **Delete** the detected duplicate request, or **Ignore** it (if it made some mistake or other reasons).

### Unable to click download button in Presets

If buttons in certain threads in `#・presets` went greyed out, it means the thread is archived. You may run the command `/reopen` to unarchive all archived threads. 

### 1-month old account restriction whitelist

To whitelist a member to bypass the `#・preset` download 1-month old account restriction, follow the steps below to ensure they're legit and not suspicious.

**Requirements to Get Whitelisted**
- The member **must provide**:
  -  A screenshot of their TikTok profile.
  - The account must be an editing account.
  - Make sure the screenshot clearly shows "**Edit profile**" — this confirms it’s their own account.

If you don’t see "Edit profile", it’s most likely fake.

**How to Check If They're Suspicious**
- Before approving, do the following:
  - Search up their TikTok username directly on TikTok.
  - Check if the account looks real: consistent content, normal follower/following ratio, not freshly made.
  - If something feels off (no posts, suspicious bio, reused content), ask follow-up questions or deny the request.
The command: `/leak whitelist`
