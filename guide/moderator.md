# Moderator's Guide {moderator}
This guide outlines moderation standards, procedures, and responsibilities.  
All moderators are expected to **understand and follow this fully**.

## General Moderation Information {#general-information}

### Expectations
- **Read and understand all server rules** (rough memorisation recommended)
- Set server notifications to **Mentions Only** (recommended) or **All Messages**
- Be familiar with **all server channels** and their purposes

### Staff Strikes System
- Strikes are given for **improper staff behaviour** or **rule violations**
- **3 strikes = demotion**

### Chat Management
- Redirect conversations to the correct channels
- Prevent spam or flooding (especially GIFs/images in chat channels)

### Ticket Support
- Respond to tickets **as quickly as possible**
- **One staff member per ticket**
- The **first staff member** to respond handles and closes the ticket

### Moderation Actions
- Use punishment commands in the channel where the incident occurred  
  *(or `#・staff-cmd` if necessary)*
- Always check previous history using: `!cases @user`

### General Guidelines
- Maintain a **family-friendly environment**
- Use **common sense**
- **Have fun :)**

## Moderation Procedures {#punishment}

### Verbal Warnings

::: info
**Trainees:** Observe how current moderators issue verbal warnings and take inspiration from their approach.
:::

- **Disrespectful behaviour**  
→ Verbal warn → 12h mute if continued

- **Arguments**  
→ Send `!fight` → 30m mute if continued

- **NSFW conversations**  
→ Verbal warn

- **Speaking in a different language**  
→ Verbal warn

- Custom reasons (`!warn (user id) (reason)`) **require approval from other moderators**

> Words like `this` are predefined reasons
