## What are the procedures for mod? {#punishment}

### **Verbal** __Warnings__

::: info  
Trainees! Please look at how current Moderators give verbal warnings and take inspiration from what they're doing and saying. Please don't use AI, it is obvious most of the time.
:::

- **Being Disrespectful:**  
> Verbal warn, if they continue: 12 hour mute.

### **Other** / __Info__

- Avoid warning new accounts, just redirect them (give them a verbal warn). If they (for example) misuse a channel more than once you can warn them.
- If you (for whatever reason) need to make your own reason, use `!warn (userid) (reason)`. Do **not** do this without asking other Moderators (or higher) first.

> Words that look like `this` are predefined reasons. Learn how to use them here: [`Predefined Reasons`](#what-are-the-predefined-reasons).
> **Don't** warn **new members** for posting something in the wrong channel. Redirect them instead.

**Ban Duration Guide**
| Type | Duration |
| ------------- | :----: |
| **DM Advertising** | 1-Day |
| **Suicide Encouragement** | 1-Week |
| **Doxxing** | Permanent |
| **NSFW Content** | Permanent |
| **Racism** | Permanent |
Always check user history with `!warnings (user)` before taking action

## What are the Predefined Reasons?

### **How to use** __Predefined Reasons__

::: info  
Predefined Reasons work for **Warns**, **Timeouts**, **Kicks** and **Bans**.
I will use `!warn` as an example, but it works the same with the other commands.
:::

```
!warn @617249450867425301 selfpromo
```
**`!warn [userid] [duration] [predefinedreason]`**

## Server Related {#server-related}

### Ticket 

If you claimed a ticket, please warn the member and close the ticket if no response are given for over 12 hours. This would help the server be less clogged.

### Booster Role

When a user opens a ticket to claim their custom role, please do the following:
1. **Verify Booster Status**: First, confirm that the member has boosted the server at least **twice** (`2x`). This is a strict requirement.
2. **Whitelist the Member**: Use the new command to grant them access to the role creation panel. (`/boosterrole whitelist`)

**Command:**
Using this command on a valid 2x booster will allow them to use `/boosterrole manage`. Please familiarize yourselves with this new procedure.

### Duplicate requests

Request duplicates can be monitored through: [#・request-log](https://discord.com/channels/1118862694980788276/1395469507014951063). You can simply **Delete** the detected duplicate request, or **Ignore** it (if it made some mistake or other reasons).

### Unable to click download button in Presets

If buttons in certain threads in `#・presets` went greyed out, it means the thread is archived. You may run the command `/reopen` to unarchive all archived threads. 

### 1-month old account restriction whitelist

To whitelist a member to bypass the `#・preset` download 1-month old account restriction, follow the steps below to ensure they're legit and not suspicious.

**Requirements to Get Whitelisted**
- The member **must provide**:
  -  A screenshot of their TikTok profile.
  - The account must be an editing account.
  - Make sure the screenshot clearly shows "**Edit profile**" — this confirms it’s their own account.

If you don’t see "Edit profile", it’s most likely fake.

**How to Check If They're Suspicious**
- Before approving, do the following:
  - Search up their TikTok username directly on TikTok.
  - Check if the account looks real: consistent content, normal follower/following ratio, not freshly made.
  - If something feels off (no posts, suspicious bio, reused content), ask follow-up questions or deny the request.
The command: `/leak whitelist`
