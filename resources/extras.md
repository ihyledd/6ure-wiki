### Note

You’ve probably heard of “free” Adobe software — it’s very common in the editing community. Below, you’ll see what we call the **main source link**.  

**What does that mean?**
It’s the primary source people use to get “free” Adobe software. We’re sharing it for those who:  
- Want to avoid unsafe or shady third-party sites.
- Prefer downloading directly from the original source.

**Important notes:**
- This is all the content available from that community — we are **not responsible** for anything that happens beyond this page.
- If you have questions about their resources, read their documentation carefully. It explains everything you’ll need to know.
- Using these tools comes with risks. However, following their guidelines closely can help keep you safe.

**For new editors:**
If you’re just starting out, we recommend **not** using this resource. Some of the terms and steps can be confusing. For a safer, more beginner-friendly experience, try one of the communities listed in the FAQ section at the bottom of this page. They may have the Adobe software you’re looking for in our site, or they can guide you better.

### **TL;DR:**
This is the main source for “free” Adobe software — use it if you know what you’re doing. It’s safe if you follow their instructions, but beginners should stick to the recommended communities in the FAQ for an easier experience.

- [Adobe Community](https://lemmy.dbzer0.com/c/GenP) This only works for Windows 10 and 11, as stated in their “wiki” on the mentioned site. The source for Mac is also provided in the same section.
