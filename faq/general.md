# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### Where are the leaks?
Our leaks are available in our Discord Server: https://discord.gg/6ure  
> You can find beginners guide here: [Beginners](/beginners)  

### How do I install [X] plugin?
Many plugins or software files include a `read me.txt` or `attention` file. Please make sure to carefully read any such file that comes with your download, as it usually contains important installation instructions. If the file is not included, you can look for installation tutorials on platforms like TikTok or YouTube.  

### Which plug-ins do I get, what are their uses?
Each plugin has a different function. If you’re new to editing, we recommend starting with Sapphire, BCC, and Magic Bullet Looks (MBL), as these are the most popular plugins in the community and provide a great starter for your edits. Be sure to check out these helpful videos explaining what each plugin does:  
- [What each plugin does](https://youtu.be/TJP2qQC5QG0?si=ODht4yKvzU_rhRhn)  
- [Another video explaining their features](https://youtu.be/93RMVIHQ-9E?si=pC4n4pCigpyz7qKi)  

### When I apply [X] to my edit, a red X appears on it.
A red X means that whatever plugin you're using is unlicensed. This means that you did not install it properly and that you should try again from scratch. Make sure to properly read the read me.txt if there is one.  

### Nothing is working, what do I do?
If you’ve tried multiple sources and still have problems, it could be due to an error on your side or an issue on our end. To fix this, you can consider getting plugins from a different source or try to find the problem if we don’t see any issues on our side. It is important to note that most of these plugins are outside our control, so problems are rare.  

You are welcome to join the server below if you'd like. They offer much broader options and assistance.

### I cannot find what I'm looking for. Can you guys update the page?
As mentioned earlier on this site, we kindly ask for your patience as we continue to upload resources. The servers listed above offer broader variety of plugins than we currently have. If you can’t find a specific resource here, we recommend checking the server for additional support.  
Also, if you’re experienced with using and patching software, you can refer to the first section under the “Extras” category for access to Adobe software. However, we strongly suggest using this only as a last option and trying the said server first.

## Downloading Presets

### What does 'Sharing has expired' means?
The download link has expired, as it is only valid for 20 minutes after clicking the download button. If you require a second download, please click the download button again to generate a new link.  

### What does 'Maximum sharing usage exceeded' means?
The download link has reached its maximum usage limit. Each link can only be used once, resulting in a single download per link. If you require a second download, kindly click the download button again to generate a new link.   

### What does 'The requested resource does not exist' means?
In most cases, the token has expired. To resolve this issue, kindly wait a few minutes and obtain a new link. If the problem persists, it is likely that the resource path is incorrect. In such instances, you may need to contact our founder or developer, @ihyledd or @tcmmi.ae, through tickets.  

### What does 'Invalid Credentials' means?
The password you entered on our website is incorrect. Please verify that you have obtained it from our official website and not from any other source.
